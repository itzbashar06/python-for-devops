# Most Important Topic in Python For DevOps Engineer Point of View

Use Python when,
1. Complex Logic
2. API Integration
3. Reusable Code
4. Error handing
5. Advanced Data Processing
   and many More .....

# Data Types
1. Numric Data Types
   1. Int:- Represents Integar (Whole Number)
   Ex- x = 5
   2. float:- Represents Floating- Point Numbers (Number With Decimal Point)
   Ex- y = 3.14

2. Sequence Data Types
   1. Str:- Represents String (Sequence Of Character)
   Ex- text = "Hello World"
   2. List:- Represents List (Ordered, Mutable)
   Ex- my_list = [1, 2, 3,] 
   3. Tuple:- Represents Tuple (Unordered, immutable)
   Ex- my_tuple = (1, 2, 3,)

3. Mapping Type
   1. Dict:- Represents Dictionary (Key Value Pairs)
   Ex- my_dict ={"name", "john", "age", "18"}

4. Set Types
   1. Set:- Represents Set (Unordered Collection or Unique Elements)
   Ex- my_set = {1, 2, 3}
   2. Frozenset:- Represents Immutable sets
   Ex- my_frozenset = ([1, 2, 3,])

5. Boolean Type
   1. Bool:- Represents Boolean (True Or False)
   Ex- is_valid = True

6. Binary Types
   1. Bytes:- represents immutable sequence of Bytes
   Ex- data = b'hello'
   3. Bytesarray:- Represents mutable sequence of bytes
   Ex- bytearray = (b'hello')

7. None Type
   1. none type:- Represents the none object which is used to indicate a null value

8. Custom Data Types:- you can also define your custom data types using class and objects


# strings
String Data Types in Python
* In python, a string is a sequence of characters, enclosed within single (' '), double (" "), or triple (''' ''') or (""" """) quotes.
* strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change the characters within a string directly. Instead, you create new strings.
* You can access individual characters in a string using indexing.
* strings support various built- in methods, such as len(), upper(), lower(), strip(), replcae() and more, for manipulation.

# String Manipulation and Formatting
* Concatenation:- You can combine strings using the + operator.
* Substring:- Use slicing to extract partions of a string, exmaple my_sring [2:5)] will extract characters from the 2nd to the 4th position.
* String Interpolation:- Python supports various ways to format strings, including f- dtrings, %-formatting and str-format().
* Escape sequence:- Special characters like newline tab and others are represented using escape sequences.
* String methods:- Python provides many bulit-in methods for string manipulation, such as split(), join() and startswith().

# Numric Data Types
Numric Data Types In Python (int, float):-
* python supports two primary numeric data types int for integar and float for floating- point numbers.
* Integars are whole number and float represents number with decimal point.
* You can perform arithmetic operations on those types, including addition, substraction, multiplication, division and more.

# Keywords in Python
Keywords are reserved words in python that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as variable names or identifiers. These words are used to define the structure and logic of the program. They are an integral part of the python language and are case- sensitive, which means you must use them exactly as specified. 
Here are some important python KEywords:-
 1. and:- It is a logical operator that returns Ture if both operands are True.
 2. or:- It is a logical operator that returns True if at least one of the operands true.
 3. not:- It is a logical operator that returns opposite of the operands truth value.
 4. if:- It is used to start a condition statement and is followed by a condition that determines whether the code block is executed.
 5. else:-It is used in conjuction with if define an alternative code block to execute when the if condition is false.
 6. elif:- short for 'else if', it is used to additional condition after an if statement and is used in combination with if and else.
 7. while:- it is used to create a loop that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
 8. for:- It is also used to create a loop that iterates over a sequence and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.
 9. in:- used with for in loop. it check if a value is present in a sequence.
 10. try:- it is a beggining of a block of code that is subject to exception handling. it is followed by except to catch and handle exceptions.
 11. except:- used with try, it defines a block of code to execute when an exception is raised in the corresponding try block.
 12. finally:- used with try, it defines a block of codes that is always executed, whether an exception is raised or not.
 13. def:- it is used to define a function.
 14. class:- it is used to define a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects in object oriented programming.
 15. return:- it is used within a function to specify the value that the function should return.
 16. import:- it is used to import a module or libraries to access their function, class or variables.
 17. from:- used with import to specify which specific components from a module should be imported.
 18. true:- it represents is boolean valur for true.
 19. false:- it represents a boolean valur for false.
 20. as:- used with import to create an alias for a module, making it easier to refrence in the code.
 21. none:- it represent a special null value or absence of value.
 22. is:- it is used to identity comparison checking if two variables refer to the same object in memory.
 23. lambda:- it is used to create small, anonymous functions.
 24. with:- it is used for content management ensuring thet certain operations are performed before and after a block of code.
 25. global:- it is used to declare a global variable within a functions scope.
 26. nonlocal:- it is used to declare a variable as nonlocal, which allows modifying a variable in an enclosing scope.
